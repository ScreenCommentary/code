<h2> 화면 해설 프로그램(Screen commentary program)</h2>

***
**📌 Objective**
> How much can we understand if we close our eyes or cover our ears? It is called **"Barrier Free"** to add screen commentary and subtitles so that both disabled and non-disabled people can see and feel the work equally.
At this time, screen commentary is an important link between the audience and the production.

***We thought about what would be inconvenient for blind people to encounter various media. Can Blind People Enjoy All YouTube Videos? That's the question that arises. So we thought of a screen commentary service for YouTube.***

First, analyze what information is in the image.

Next, the algorithm determines *which* of the many pieces of information analyzed and how to convey it.

Identify *where the information to be delivered will be guided to the voice*, and insert it appropriately between images to guide it.

At this point, the position where the voice will be guided should *not appear before the screen in an empty space* that does not overlap the line.
